Friendly SyntaxError tracebacks - in English
=============================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
This file contains only examples of SyntaxError.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_syntax_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_tb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.0.4

SyntaxError - Assign to keyword
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception: 
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax (raise_syntax_error1.py, line 3)

    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    There could be many possible reasons:
    - a keyword might be misspelled;
    - a colon, :, or some other symbol like (, ], etc., might be missing;
    - etc.

    Likely cause:
        Python could not parse the file 'raise_syntax_error1.py'
        beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.

       1: """ Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: pass = 2
               ^
        My best guess: you were trying to assign a value
        to a Python keyword. This is not allowed.


SyntaxError - Missing colon 1
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception: 
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax (raise_syntax_error2.py, line 3)

    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    There could be many possible reasons:
    - a keyword might be misspelled;
    - a colon, :, or some other symbol like (, ], etc., might be missing;
    - etc.

    Likely cause:
        Python could not parse the file 'raise_syntax_error2.py'
        beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.

       1: """Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: if True
                 ^
       My best guess: you wrote a statement beginning with
       'if' but forgot to add a colon ':' at the end


SyntaxError - Missing colon 2
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception: 
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax (raise_syntax_error3.py, line 3)

    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    There could be many possible reasons:
    - a keyword might be misspelled;
    - a colon, :, or some other symbol like (, ], etc., might be missing;
    - etc.

    Likely cause:
        Python could not parse the file 'raise_syntax_error3.py'
        beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.

       1: """Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: while True  # a comment
                                 ^
       My best guess: you wrote a 'while' loop but
       forgot to add a colon ':' at the end
